I offer complete mail server development for $900, payable in two installments. Payments can be made via Wise or USDT.

I will build a high-performance mail server for you, ensuring top deliverability with a 10/10 score on Mail Tester—your emails will consistently reach inboxes without sending limits or blacklisting issues.

For the setup, I will need SSH access to an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS server with at least 8 GB RAM and 200+ GB SSD storage. Additionally, a domain or subdomain will be required for the mail server configuration. I’ll handle advanced DNS pointing as part of the process.

Delivery is within 72 hours, including testing to confirm everything is running smoothly.
